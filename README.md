For this Css to work i am using Stylus wich is an addon/plugin you get to your browser. i am currently using chrome but it works for firefox aswell.

Addon for firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/
Plugin for chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en

it can be a little fiddely to get running but ill try to guide you, allthough through Chrome, i belive its almost the same for firefox.

1. once you have Stylus installed you will have to go to Https://beta.lanista.se
2. once youre at Lanista you can click on stylus at the top right corner
3. you will get a few alternatives but in the bottom there will be something in the lines of "write style for" and a url
4. make sure it's beta.lanista.se , then you press the url and there shuld be a text editor window popping up.
5. once youre inside of this editor the choice is yours, copy any of the Custom Css themes of your liking and paste it there.
6. make sure to save it and BAM welcome to custom club.

Feel free to edit any of my custom css to your liking.
There will probably be some bugs im no expert at all in coding.

Have a good day.
